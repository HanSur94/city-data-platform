# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-05)

**Core value:** Citizens and city officials can see all publicly available city data in one place, on a map, updated live — no technical expertise required.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-05 — Roadmap created; 53 requirements mapped across 10 phases

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Hybrid architecture chosen — FastAPI + TimescaleDB + PostGIS + NGSI-LD compat layer (not full FIWARE Orion)
- Init: Frontend on port 4000 (Grafana occupies 3000 on target system)
- Init: Town config YAML from line one — Aalen is `CITY_ID=aalen`, never hardcoded
- Init: Build order: schema first, then one vertical slice (transit + air quality), then expand
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17 image — bundles TimescaleDB + PostGIS in one container (timescale/timescaledb-postgis is deprecated)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Alembic include_object filter excludes _hyper_* indexes and _timescaledb_internal schema to prevent spurious DROP INDEX migrations
- [Phase 01-foundation]: DATABASE_URL dual-mode: +asyncpg for FastAPI runtime, stripped to plain postgresql:// for Alembic sync driver

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: LUBW air quality station IDs for Aalen must be confirmed before connector scope is finalized
- Phase 2: MobiData BW GTFS-RT feed quality needs validation step (GTFS Canonical Validator) before transit connector is marked complete
- Phase 7: MDM/Mobilithek traffic feed access may require registration — verify before committing; BASt count data is fallback
- Phase 7: Stadtwerke APIs for water/electricity/wastewater are highly fragmented — may require per-Aalen discovery spike
